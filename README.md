## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate mobile app developer with 2.5+ years of experience building scalable, production-level React Native apps. I specialize in integrating advanced features like AI, Firebase architecture, and native module bridging. I’ve worked on both startup products and personal projects, some of which are live on the Play Store and App Store.
